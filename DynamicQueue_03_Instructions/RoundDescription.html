        <p>In each round of a match, "tasks" will arrive for processing and join the <strong class="inlineTable">Task Queue</strong>.

            You and the participant you are paired with will work together to process the task queue. Specifically, in each round,
            you will choose how much capacity to allocate (either <strong class="inlineOption1">1</strong> unit
            or <strong class="inlineOption2">2</strong> units). The participant you are paired with will also choose
            how much capacity to allocate (either <strong class="inlineOption1">1</strong> unit or <strong class="inlineOption2">2</strong> units).</p>

        <p> We denote the <strong style="color: blue;">sum</strong> of your choice and the choice of the participant you are paired with as the <strong style="color: blue;">Total Capacity</strong> in that round.
            For example, if you choose <strong class="inlineOption2">2</strong> and the participant you are paired with chooses <strong class="inlineOption2">2</strong>
            then the Total Capacity is 4.</p>

        <p> The number of tasks that can be processed in a given round is the smaller of the <strong style="color: blue;">Total Capacity</strong>
            and the <strong class="inlineTable"># of Tasks in the Queue</strong>.
            For example, if the total capacity is 4 but there are 3 tasks in the queue, then 3 tasks will be processed in that round. Another example --
            if the total capacity is 2 but there are 3 tasks in the queue, then 2 tasks will be processed in that round and 1 <strong style="font-style: italic">Leftover Task</strong>
            will remain in the queue for the next round. Thus, the two of you can process available tasks in a round up to the total capacity in that round.</p>
